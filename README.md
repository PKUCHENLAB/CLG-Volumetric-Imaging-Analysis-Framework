Zebrafish Project

If you want to compute the correlation matrix of your time-series data and choose a threshold based on the distribution of correlations, please run the code file `ZebrafishProject\main\corrdistributionon.py`. In this script, we provide the distribution lines for four percentiles (95 %, 90 %, 85 %, 80 %) as candidate thresholds, and you will also obtain the corresponding visualization. You can choose an appropriate threshold and correlation-value rule according to the observed distribution to construct your network.

Once you have selected an appropriate threshold and correlation-value rule for building your network, proceed by running the code file `ZebrafishProject\main\bulidyournetwork.py`. In the script, set the input and output paths for your data file, specify your chosen rule for selecting correlation values, and define the threshold you have decided on. Then execute the script. We have also included network-visualization output file in the code. You can use the generated network plot to verify whether your chosen threshold and correlation-value rule meet your expectations.
