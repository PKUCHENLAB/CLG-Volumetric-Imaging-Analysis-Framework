Zebrafish Project

If you want to compute the correlation matrix of your time-series data and choose a threshold based on the distribution of correlations, please run the file `Zebrafish-Project\main\corrdistributionon.py`. In this file we provide threshold distribution lines at four percentiles (95 %, 90 %, 85 %, 80 %), and you will also obtain the corresponding visualization plots. You can then select an appropriate threshold according to the data distribution to construct a suitable network.
